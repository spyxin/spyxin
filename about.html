            No longer a student, what a sad life.... I chill in my room with my cat and my lil birdie. They both, alongside with me, love to sleep pretty much all day, only really getting up to go and eat something. I really need to be looking for a job, or at least somewhere to volunteer, but the idea of being around strangers is terryfiying, so fuck no.
